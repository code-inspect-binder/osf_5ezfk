Metadata_MODIS
Metadata information for the data in the MODIS folder for the: "How do I use satellite and global reanalysis data for hydrological simulations in SWAT?" workshop which was given in Montevideo between 7 - 11 August 2017, jointly organised by the University of Sydney, IRI (the University of Columbia) and INIA, Uruguay.

This folder contains two subfolders, which include the MODIS16A ET timeseries between 2000 and 2014 downloaded as subsets from http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/ using the package MODIStools (https://github.com/seantuck12/MODISTools). The script for downloading the data is included in the document B_RainfallRunoffCalibrationWithET.pdf for the Cotter catchment, and in ExtractMODIS_SLucia.pdf for the Santa Lucia catchment.

The data are extracted based on the subbasin midpoints using the Subbasins_cotter.csv and the subbasins_SantaLucia.csv files
